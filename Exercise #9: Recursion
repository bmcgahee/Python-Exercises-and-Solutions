Exercise #9:  Recursion

1.  Write a recursive function that returns the factorial of a number n, i.e. n! = n*(n - 1)*(n - 2)*....*1
    What is the value of 50!?

2.  Write a recursive function that is based on the recursive sequence a(1) = 2, a(n+1) = a(n) - 1.
    What is the value of a(100)?

3.  Write a recursive function that returns the nth Fibonacci number.  
    The Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,... What is the 32nd Fibonacci number?
