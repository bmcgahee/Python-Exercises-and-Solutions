Here are the solutins for Exercise #5.

A.
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print "$" + str(i)

This while loop executes an infinite number of times since 0 < 10,
and the value of i is not increasing inside the while loop.

B.
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print "$" + str(i)
    i = i + 1

This while loop executes 10 times since 9 - 0 + 1 = 10.

The while loop that is more practical to use is the one that will eventually terminate when a given condition is false.  
So, B. is the more practical while loop.
