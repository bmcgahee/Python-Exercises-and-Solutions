Exercise #7: Functions

1. Create a function called "average" that takes in 2 numbers and returns the average of those 2 numbers.
   Call the function and input 2 numbers to make sure it works.  

2. Create a function called "longString that takes in a string and returns true if the length of the string
   is at least 10 characters or false if the length of the string is less than 10 characters.

3. Create a function called "guessMyNumber that takes in one number between 1-50.  The function must
   contain a random number variable.  If the input number is the same as the random number, return "you win!"
   Otherwise, return "sorry, you lose."  

4. Create a function called "reverse" that takes in a string and returns the reversed string.  
   You may use a Python function to reverse the string if you like.  
   For example, reverse("hello") = "olleh".
   
5. Create a function called "sortList" that takes in 5 numbers, stores them into a list in that order, 
   and then sorts them in ascending order.  The function must return the original list and the sorted list.
   You may use a Python function to sort the list if you like.
