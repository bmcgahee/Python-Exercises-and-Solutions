Here is the solution to Exercise #3.

firstName = raw_input("Enter your first name: ")
lastName = raw_input("Enter your last name: ")
course = raw_input("Enter your course name: ")
testScore1 = int(raw_input("Enter first test score: "))
testScore2 = int(raw_input("Enter second test score: "))
testScore3 = int(raw_input("Enter third test score: "))
testScore4 = int(raw_input("Enter fourth test score: "))
testScore5 = int(raw_input("Enter fifth test score: "))

average = (testScore1 + testScore2 + testScore3 + testScore4 + testScore5) / 5.0
grade = round(average, 0)
letter = " "

if grade >= 90:
    letter = "A"
elif grade >= 80:
    letter = "B"
elif grade >= 70:
    letter = "C"
elif grade >= 60:
    letter = "D"
else:
    letter = "F"

print "Name: " + firstName + " " + lastName
print "Course: " + course
print "Average: " + str(grade) + "%"
print "Grade: " + letter
