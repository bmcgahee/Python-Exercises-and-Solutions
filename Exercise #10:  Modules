Exercise #10:  Modules

1.  Import the time module with the time.sleep(seconds) function to write a program that displays countdown starting at 10 
    all the way down to 1 with one second intervals between counts and then prints out the statement "Blast off!"
    Hint:  Use a For Loop to do this.  You can only use the time.sleep(seconds) function once in the program.

2.  Import the datetime module to show the current date and time.  Then find the number of days from the current date until
    Thanksgiving 2015.

3.  Import the math module to calculate the following.
    a) Find the sum of the set of values {1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32}.  
       If you continue to include more numbers with this pattern, what value does this sum approach?
    b) Round the value of pi to 15 decimal places.
    c) Use the modulus function math.fmod(x, y) to find the remainder of 256 / 77. 
    d) Find the greatest common divisor of 1776 and 2012 by using the following code snippet below.
       What is the least common multiple of these numbers?  Hint:  lcm(x, y) = x*y / gcd(x, y)
       from fractions import gcd
