Here are the solutions for Exercise #4

A.
stars = 0
for i in range(1, 6):
    print "*" * i
    stars = stars + i
print "The star pyramid contains " + str(stars) + " stars."

B.
numbers = int(raw_input("How many natural numbers do you want to search? "))
count = 0
for i in range(1, numbers + 1):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 2 != 0:
        print i
        count += 1
print "Total amount of odd numbers that are divisible by three between the number 1 and " + str(numbers) + " is: " + str(count)
