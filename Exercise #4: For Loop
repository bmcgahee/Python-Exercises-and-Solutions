Exercise #4: For Loop

A. Write a program in Python that uses a for loop to display 1 star in the first row, 2 stars in the second row, 
3 stars in the third row, 4 stars in the fourth row, and 5 stars in the fifth row.
Also, use the for loop to calculate the total number of stars 

Your output should look like the following.

*
**
***
****
*****
The star pyramid contains 15 stars.  

B. Write a program in Python that asks the user how many natural numbers they want to search in the for loop.  
   User must request at least two numbers, but the more numbers you have the longer the search and 
   more results you will get.  
   
   Note:  The set of natural numbers N = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...
   
   Your for loop in the program must calculate and display the following.
   
   1. All odd numbers between 1 and N that are divisible by three.
   2. The total amount of odd numbers betweeen 1 and N that are divisible by three.  
   
   For example, if you want to let N = 20, then your output should look like this.
   
   3
   9
   15
   Total amount of odd numbers that are divisible by three between the numbers 1 and 20 is: 3
