Exercise #6: Lists

1. Write a program that asks the user to enter five of your favorite foods in no particular orderand store them in a list.
Make sure you sort all the items in the list in alphabetical order.  

For example, if your five favorite foods are pizza, steak, chicken, hamburger, and ice cream, then your output should 
look like this.

['chicken', 'hamburger', 'ice cream', 'pizza', 'steak']

2. Write a program that asks the user to enter in 3 numbers for one list and 3 numbers for another list.  Then find the sum 
and difference of the corresponding elements in the list.  

For example if list A = [1, 2, 4] and list B = [-1, 3, 5] then the sum A + B = [0, 5, 9] and 
the difference A - B = [2, -1, -1].

So, the output should look like this.

The sum is:
[0, 5, 9]
The difference is:
[2, -1, -1]
